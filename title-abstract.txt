Title:
Network Signal Anomaly Detection

Abstract:
Network degradation occurs in many forms, and our project will focus on two common factors: packet loss and latency. Packet loss occurs when one or more data packets transmitted across a computer network fail to reach their destination. Latency can be defined as a measure of delay for data to transmit across a network. For internet users, high rates of packet loss and significant latency can manifest in jitter or lag, which are indicators of overall poor network performance as perceived by the end user. Thus, when issues arise in these two factors, it would be beneficial for internet service providers to know exactly when the user is experiencing problems in real time. In real world scenarios, situations or environments such as poor port quality, overloaded ports, network congestion and more can impact overall network performance. In order to detect some of these issues in network transmission data, we built an anomaly detection system that predicts the estimated packet loss and latency of a connection and detects whether there is a significant degradation of network quality for the duration of the connection.
